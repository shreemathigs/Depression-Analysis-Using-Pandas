# 📘 Depression Analysis Using Python & Pandas
## 📌 Overview

This project explores a Depression Analysis Dataset containing information such as age, gender, profession, academic pressure, sleep duration, dietary habits, family history of mental illness, suicidal thoughts, and depression status.

The goal of this analysis is to:

 - Understand the key factors associated with depression

 - Identify trends and patterns in lifestyle, work/study conditions, and mental health

 - Generate meaningful insights using Python and pandas

 - Build a foundation for predictive modeling in future work

This project is fully executed in Google Colab and uses pandas for data handling and Python for analysis.
